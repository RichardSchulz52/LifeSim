# LifeSim
A life simulation in the godot engine. Currently there are hunters, prey and plants.
The project is made with behaviour trees and proper composition. Plants are spawned with a chance related to the number of availabe grass tiles.

TODOs
* split animals by the only two genders
* make a plant reproduction system so the prey can die if they overconsume/reproduce
* make the UI addaptive the the camera size
* a gene system with balancing. For example faster movement must be balanced by higher calories consumption. 
* save the data about population size and genetics to visualize
