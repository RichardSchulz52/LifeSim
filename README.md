# LifeSim
A life simulation in the godot engine. Currently there are hunters, prey and plants.
The project is made with behaviour trees and proper composition.

TODOs
* reproduction of hunters
* split animals by the only two genders
* a gene system with balancing. For example faster movement must be balanced by higher calories consumption. 
* save the data about population size and genetics to visualize
